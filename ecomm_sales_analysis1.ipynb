    "1. Situation (What happened?)\n",
    "Three products have the most orders: \"WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER\", \"REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER\", and \"JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT\". They are the most popular items in the shop.\n",
    " \n",
    "The highest revenue comes from \"DOTCOM POSTAGE\". This is a delivery fee, not a physical product. It means many customers pay for shipping.\n",

    "These popular items are cheap. Customers come to the shop to buy them first and then add other things to their cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run out of these \"top products,\" we will lose many customers and total sales will drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recommendations (What to do?)\n",
    "Stock: Always keep these top 3 items in the warehouse. Don't let them run out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales: Try to sell these popular items together with other products (bundles) to make more money from one order.\n",
